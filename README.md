# Assistant
Lets build this virtual assistant which automates all our tasks

This application has two modes
1) Normal Mode
2) Command mode

Norml Mode:
    In normal mode the assistant will answer your questions and give response to some basic questions. It can even solve Mathamatical problems also. 
    
Command Mode:
    For starting the command mode the user have to say 'cmd' which sets the assistant into command mode. Once you entered the command mode you can acces all the commands by saying their name. some of the commands include
    
-> sms - For sending sms to a mobile number using fast2sms

-> email - For sending emails using google smtp

-> roll - This can be used by institutes for releasing results or by individuals for storing contacts and data etc...

The most important part of the assistant is Command Mode as we can customize it to our needs and we can automate all our daily tasks or boring tasks using this mode.

-->This mode also helps handicaped people for doing their works 

The reason behind making this project is its ability to customize, as all the program works in the server so new features can be added easily so the usage of this assistant can be boosted rapidly.

We are working on automating more tasks by using it, any contributions or ideas are accepted


Usage:
    This Program runs in the server and user will be provided with a mobile application through which he can access all the services
